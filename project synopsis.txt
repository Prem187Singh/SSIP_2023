Problem Statement
 Wifi Based Classroom Attendance Application



                                                                            // Synopsis Abstract

In an era driven by technology, the traditional method of manual attendance taking in classrooms has become increasingly inefficient and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a cutting-edge solution â€“ the WiFi Based Classroom Attendance Application. This innovative application, compatible with both Android and iOS platforms, leverages the power of AI-based face recognition to revolutionize the attendance recording process.

In educational institutions, WiFi access points are omnipresent within or near classrooms, making them an ideal infrastructure to facilitate seamless attendance management. With our mobile application, faculty members can effortlessly initiate attendance sessions by a simple tap on their smartphones. Once initiated, students, while connected to the same WiFi network, have the opportunity to mark their attendance through the application.

The system ensures that attendance submission is swift and secure. It empowers faculty members to monitor and control the session, allowing them to close the attendance window at their discretion. Once the session concludes, students are no longer able to submit their attendance, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data.

To further enhance the convenience and utility of the application, session-wise attendance records are automatically stored on a centralized server. Faculty members can easily retrieve these records in MS-Excel format, simplifying administrative tasks. This efficient and user-friendly system not only streamlines the attendance tracking process but also offers comprehensive data management capabilities.

This is a  WiFi Based Classroom Attendance Application and is poised to usher in a new era of attendance management, where time-consuming manual processes are  replaced by a seamless, technology-driven solution. With its emphasis on ease of use, data accuracy, and accessibility, this application promises to enhance the educational experience for both faculty and students, ensuring that precious time is devoted to learning and not administrative tasks.
